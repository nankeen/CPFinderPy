# ACPF Python Port
This was ported from the [Admin-Control-Panel-Finder](https://github.com/AppoPro/Admin-Control-Panel-Finder) Perl script to Python 3

This was written because I wanted to sharpen my Python skills

The script should run with the Python 3.5 standard library

## Usage
`./acpf.py host[:port] source`

Where source is either php, asp, aspx, cfm, js, cgi or brf.
The paths for each specific source can be changed in `path.json`
